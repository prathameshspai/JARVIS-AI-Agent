# JARVIS: Jenkins Agent for Retry, Validation & Intelligent Summary
JARVIS is an AI agent designed to analyze and heal test failures within Jenkins pipelines. It leverages LLMs to diagnose and categorize test failures and intelligently retry those deemed retry-worthy. As part of the roadmap, the agent is planned to provide root-cause insights, self-heal by suggesting fixes for common issues and produce analytics.
